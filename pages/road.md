_NOTE: DRAFT_

Data Chefs is a work in progress. Here's what we've done so far and where we are heading next.

## Experiments at ASHA (v0.1)

Before I took a sabbatical to create [Makers All]( https://makersall.org/), I was the manager of the [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association](https://www.asha.org/) (ASHA)'s Decision Support Services team. ASHA was a midsized organization, but because of the wide range of services ASHA provided its members, it had a need for postal and email list cutting, analytics and other reports, and data science analyses that far outstripped what my team could provide. While we could handle many requests using self-service solutions, there was no way ASHA could afford to hire enough dedicated business analysts and data scientists to keep up with the number of complex requests we were getting.

So, my team began exploring how to provide the data infrastructure, training, and mentoring to create an ecosystem of power users. We tried using everything from Excel and PowerBI to what we called "Baby SQL" -- flattened and cleaned up data that users could manipulate with only a handful of SQL commands -- to R and pandas to scikit-learn, as well as a variety of off-the-shelf tools (e.g., Alteryx). 

Three facts quickly became apparent:
- Despite the fact that a lot of corporations and large nonprofits were struggling with how to support their power users, nobody seemed to have a good model or framework for how to think about how to do it.
- Most large organizations were going to have to spend a fair amount of either staff or external resources to come up with a good solution -- e.g., creating cheat sheets, quick and dirty trainings, etc.
- At the same time, a lot of tech groups in marginalized communities didn't have anywhere near enough resources to be able to develop the infrastructure needed to give more than a handful of members of their community a shot at getting a job in the data world at a time when most large organizations were struggling to find enough analytics/data science staff.

So where we could steal a little time, we began to play around with a model for pooling resources across large organizations and leveraging those resources to also help folks in community. We called it Data Chefs, and we started [blogging]( https://dchefs.wordpress.com/) about our ideas.

Because we spent so much time just trying to keep our heads above water, we never got much beyond playing with these ideas. But we did find opportunities to do some interesting experiments.

For example, in my last year at ASHA, my team got the green light to create an initiative to make ASHA into a data visualization-literate organization (as part of a broader program to make ASHA a data-driven organization). The initiative consisted of 2 projects: 
- Data Visualization Ambassadors ("Divas"), an enterprise-wide network of users who were trained and supported in advocating for the effective use of data viz in their unit
- The Shiny Object Task Force, which explored the strategic, creative use of new data viz technology such as D3.js and VR/AR. In doing so, the Task Force also acted as an informal way of retaining some of the most skilled staff throughout ASHA, giving them a chance to do creative, cutting-edge work (rather than outsourcing these interesting, fun challenges to pricey, outside vendors).


## New Principles, Strategy (v0.2)

After I left ASHA, I spent a 2 year sabbatical creating Makers All, running pilot experiments, talking with people, thinking, and writing. Eventually I pulled together everything I'd learned and turned it into a report, [Makers All: How to Help Communities Transform Emerging Tech So They Can Shape Their Destinies,](https://toolkit.makersall.org/). 

After I'd published the report, it was time to start looking for work. And as I ended up having conversations with a variety of people at different organizations and consulting jobs, I realized that if you took a lot of the ideas I’d developed in the report and scaled them down, they’d make a great place to start growing thriving corporate ecosystems for power users. So, I started playing around with a completely revamped version of Data Chefs that was focused around a core set of [seven principles](../principles/) and a new draft [strategy](../strategy/).

The end result: some really interesting ideas that didn't quite gel into a coherent whole.

It also became apparent that:
- Although some of the core ideas behind Data Chefs have a lot of promise, it's simply too early to try to pull them all together; the only way to make that happen is to try out a bunch of experiments in several organizations
- Until I've recovered from a major injury to both of my knees, which for several years has greatly reduced my ability to either sit or stand for extended periods of times, I'm simply not physically able to do the relationship building necessary to pull together a group of folks from a variety of organizations and turn Data Chefs from an idea into reality

So if working on the big picture doesn't make sense right now, where does Data Chefs go next?
