## The Limits of Today's Efforts to Democratize Working with Data

Plenty of people and tool makers  say they want to democratize analytics and data science. But too often what this means is:
- They build great point-and-click tools that make it really easy to do some tasks. But if the user needs to go a little beyond that, they fall off a cliff. For example, many new "Auto ML" tools that reduce the work needed for machine learning, most users have no idea about the critical assumptions and implicit decisions that are built into the tools. As these tools become critical to an organization's success, this isn't sustainable.

- When they say "democratize," they make it easier than it used to be. But getting started is still way too intimidating for most beginners. For example, pandas and R have built great communities that have given more folks access to working with data. But they don't notice that it's still too intimidating for most beginners, primarily because of selection bias.

## A New Approach: Smoothing the Learning Curve
One of Data Chefs' core principles is that if we want to truly democratize analytics and data science we need to smooth the learning curve. What that means is
- Make it as easy as possible for users to get started
- Make it easy to continue to learn and grow as a user's needs expand
  
Or to put it another way, Data Chefs' goal is to create a smooth learning curve from novice to data analyst to data scientist.


## Iteratively Making Progress

Data Chefs' argues that:
- Individual organizations should start by using a chopped down, lightweight version of Maker All's strategy focused on a collaboration between their organization's developers/vendors and their users. For example, instead of trying to improve the overall UX of the pandas data science library, an organization might create a simple, lightweight library on top of pandas that makes it much easier to use pandas to address a few specific user or department needs, plus some template Jupyter notebooks and cheat sheets that target those needs.
- As organizations begin to build bridges among power user ecosystems, start taking baby steps towards the more expansive collaboration envisioned by Makers All
