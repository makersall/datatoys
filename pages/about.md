Data Chefs is a framework to help organizations unleash the power of analytics and data science by growing organizational ecosystems of power users / "[citizen data scientists](https://blogs.gartner.com/carlie-idoine/2018/05/13/citizen-data-scientists-and-why-they-matter/)" -- and to do so in a way that in the long term will also help the community.

Data Chefs is based on decades of field experience as well as [research by Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org).

Data Chefs was developed by Anders Schneiderman, Makers Allâ€™s director. He is a sociologist turned techie, with over 30 years of experience as a developer, software project manager and adult tech trainer at labor unions, corporations, nonprofits, and government. He can be reached by email (aschneiderman a.t makersall do.t org) or Twitter (@raschneiderman).

If you're interested in trying out Data Chefs in your organization, please contact Anders at aschneiderman a.t makersall do.t org.

<!-- Because these tools aren't magic:

- __Easy to Use Doesn't Mean Easy to Master__.  Just because tools let users do more doesn't mean it's easy for users to use them effectively. For example, when power users reach the point where they need to go beyond what's simple to do with a tool, they'll need guidance if they aren't going to end up squandering huge amounts of time. This is especially true because unlike data scientists and database developers, many power users won't be using their skills every day or even every week
- __Lots of Power Users + No Discipline = Rat's Nest__.  As lots of power users take on responsibility for more complex data work, if they don't adopt at least a lightweight version of version control, lifecycle management, data governance, etc., organizations will end up replacing rigid, centralized monoliths with a decentralized Wild West. But if organizations treat power users like software developers and data scientists, they'll create structures that will undermine the advantages of empowering power users. And in finding that balance, they'll also have to figure out how to overcome resistance they'll inevitably encounter from many departments. -->

<!-- To achieve these goals, Data Chefs advocates for [7 principles](principles/) for growing thriving ecosystems of power users. -->
